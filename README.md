AppStore is a fictional online platform, allowing users to download different apps on their cell phone.
The AppStore database consists of a single table - apps, which contains information about the different available apps.
The appstore_mysql file connects you to the database while the appstore_queries are pretty much self explanatory queries that give insights on any table it pulls up.  Like displaying the maximum rating of apps in the Education category.
